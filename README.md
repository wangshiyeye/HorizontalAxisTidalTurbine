# HorizontalAxisTidalTurbine— CFD Model
This repository contains the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model developed and validated as part of the research paper listed below. The model simulates the unsteady hydrodynamic performance of a horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) under combined wave-current loading conditions, and was used alongside machine learning surrogate models (Gaussian Process Regression) and global sensitivity analysis (Sobol indices) to quantify the influence of key hydrodynamic parameters.
